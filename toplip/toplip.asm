	; toplip.asm: Command line file encryption/decryption utility that includes
	;   plausible deniability, PNG/JPG embedding, very strong anti-brute-forcing,
	;   very strong encryption.
	;
	; Full commentary below.
	;
	; usage: ./toplip [-b] [-d] [-r] [-m mediafile] [[-nomix|-drbg][-1][-c COUNT][-i ITER ]-alt inputfile] [-nomix|-drbg][-1][-c COUNT][-i ITER ]inputfile
	; -b == input/output in base64 (see below notes)
	; -d == decrypt the inputfile
	; -r == generate (and display of course) one time 48 byte each pass phrases as base64
	; -m mediafile == for encrypting only, merge the output into the specified mediafile.
	;      Valid media types: PNG, JPG (plain JFIF or EXIF).
	;      (Note that decrypting will auto-detect and attempt to extract if the inputfile for 
	;      decryption is given a media file).
	; -1 == for each input file (-alt or main), this option disables the use of cascaded
	;      AES256, and instead uses a single AES256 context (two for the XTS-AES stage).
	; -c COUNT == for each input file (-alt or main), this option overrides the default count
	;      of one (1) passphrase. Specifying a higher count here will ask for this many actual
	;      passphrases, and generate this number of separate key material and crypto contexts
	;      that are then used over-top of each other.
	; -i ITER == for each input file (-alt or main), specify an alternate iteration count
	;      for scrypt's internal use of PBKDF2-SHA512 (default is 1). For the initial 8192
	;      bytes of key material, and before one-way AES key grinding of same, we use scrypt
	;      and this option overrides how many iterations of PBKDF2-SHA512 it will perform
	;      for each passphrase. (NOTE: this can _dramatically_ increase the calc times).
	;      Hex values or decimal values permitted (e.g. 10, 0xfff, etc).
	; -drbg == for each input file, by default the 8192 bytes of key material is xor'd with
	;      TLSv1.2 PRF(SHA256) of the supplied passphrase(s). This option will mix the key
	;      material with HMAC_DRBG(SHA256) instead.
	; -nomix == for each input file (see -drbg), this option specifies no additional mixing
	;      of the scrypt generated 8192 byte key material.
	; -alt inputfile == generate one or more "Plausible Deniability" file (encrypting only)
	;      This will ask for another set of passphrases, which MUST NOT be the same.
	;      Without this option, three alternate contents are randomly generated such that it is
	;      impossible to tell by examining the encrypted output whether there is or is not
	;      anything other than pure random. See the -noalt option for what happens without
	;      this option. This option can be specified up to 3 times (for a max of 4 files).
	; -noalt == Do not generate additional random data. By default, extra random data is
	;      inserted into the encrypted output such that forensic analysis (with a valid set
	;      of passphrases) on a given encrypted output does not cover all of the ciphertext
	;      present. See further commentary below about why the default setting is a good thing.
	;      Specifying this option means that no extra random data is inserted into the output
	;      (and this might be useful if you do not need plausible deniability, or you are
	;      dealing with very large files).
	; if -b is specified for encrypt, base64 of the encrypted goods is output to stdout
	; if -b is specified for decrypt, it is assumed the input is base64, and plaintext is output to stdout
	;
	; NOTE: for base64 and media merging, all crypto input/output must be _BUFFERED IN MEMORY_.
	; NOTE 2: for plausible-deniability automatic extras, they will be IN MEMORY also, so for very large
	;      inputs, make sure you have enough VM.
	;
	; passphrase acquisition is done via stdin with stderr prompts if -r not specified
	;
	;
	; The reason this code exists is because there is a distinct lack of command-line crypto
	; that has the following features (top-level overview, keep reading for a more technical explanation):
	;    1) Plausible deniability: The ability to embed multiple payloads with different
	;       passphrase materials inside the same crypto block in a way that makes it impossible
	;       to conclusively identify the number of payloads that exist (if any). While this
	;       of course does not cover actual "Rubber-hose cryptanalysis", what it does provide
	;       are ways to plausibly open a crypted bundle with controlled exposure risk, and no
	;       way outside the rubber-hose method for an attacker to know positively whether MORE
	;       payloads exist or not.
	;    2) Multiple passphrase protection: The ability to, at encryption time, specify the number
	;       and complexity (iterations, mixing) of passphrases for a given payload. Used properly, this
	;       dramatically increases the difficulty level for password-based brute force recovery.
	;    3) No easily identified output markers or alignment: No "file header", and no fixed
	;       alignment for output means that it is impossible to determine by quick examination
	;       whether a file with otherwise-random data was produced by this code or not.
	;    4) The ability to embed and extract crypted materials in common image types (PNG/JPG):
	;       Unless you are working on crypto, it is unlikely that you have a reason to have a
	;       slew of files that look like random data in your posession. Placing important or
	;       otherwise private encrypted materials inside images means that a casual observer will
	;       not discover there is any extraneous data inside the image to begin with (and the same
	;       images can be opened/viewed without revealing they are carrying payloads).
	;    5) Simplified protection against brute force recovery: OpenSSL's enc/dec command line
	;       certainly works, but as has been documented repeatedly over the years, its key
	;       derivation function appears to still use MD5, and it still appears that we can't set
	;       even the iteration count it uses. We employ scrypt-SHA512 for the base key derivation
	;       and depending on command-line options, mix in either TLSv1.2 PRF or HMAC-DRBG with it,
	;       and allow command-line options to specify the PBKDF2 iteration count (that scrypt
	;       itself uses). In addition to this, we use the resultant 8192 bytes of key material
	;       as one-way sets of AES256 keys, and then use AES256 as a CSPRNG to further grind
	;       on the 8192 bytes of key material. Combined with the option to specify an arbitrary
	;       number of multiple passphrases per encrypted input file, this effectively renders
	;       password-based brute force recovery a very difficult exercise.
	;
	; Cryptographic design motivations:
	; 1) Passphrase-based key derivation
	;    Computationally expensive key derivation, combined with optional cascading of multiple keys
	;    was the primary objective. This was specifically to render high-speed passphrase brute forcing
	;    difficult, and in a user-specified way (with command line options that obviously need to be
	;    remembered along with passphrases themselves).
	; 
	;    Thanks to cryptocurrency proliferation, there are now a great many hash accelerators. Things
	;    like hashcat.net (hats off to that) and others mean that "simple" or straightforward hash based
	;    KDF don't provide the same level of protection for passphrases. By modifying scrypt to make use
	;    of HMAC-SHA512 in its initial and final stages of PBKDF2, and further by allowing arbitrary
	;    iterations counts for same, we can effectively render "purist" hash brute forcers ineffective.
	;    Further, that we obviously do not store any part of the "computed hash" (key material) in the
	;    output, means that all brute force attempts will require a minimum number of calculations,
	;    much in the same way that traditional disk encryption uses. By combining the output from
	;    scrypt-SHA512 with other PRFs and performing one-way AES256 key "grinding", the task for
	;    brute forcing is considerably more expensive than any single PBKDF method.
	;
	; 2) Plausible deniability payload discovery
	;    The ability to optionally embed multiple payloads inside the same contiguous output without
	;    disclosing the existence of same, each with their own separate passphrases/key materials.
	;
	; 3) Payload confidentiality
	;    Making use of XTS-AES in combination with our cascaded AES256, as well as cascaded XTS-AES
	;    itself.
	;
	; Technical design commentary:
	; 1) Underlying crypto methods
	;    No "new" or "homebrew" crypto has been used here. AES256, HMAC-SHA512, scrypt (and thus
	;    PBKDF2), TLSv1.2 PRF(SHA256), HMAC-DRBG(SHA256), and XTS-AES (via htxts) have been put together
	;    in carefully considered ways to achieve the aforementioned design goals.
	;
	;    As explained briefly above, each passphrase supplied is passed to scrypt-sha512 to derive 8192
	;    bytes of key material. Command line options allow for specifying a >1 PBKDF2 iteration count
	;    that the underlying scrypt function uses. Note that the SALT used for scrypt (and other mixing
	;    functions) is 32 bytes of PRNG output.
	;
	;    Depending on command line options, this 8192 bytes is then further manipulated (listed per opt):
	;      -nomix: Nothing further is done.
	;      -drbg: HMAC_DRBG(SHA256) is used, seeded with SALT || SHA512(passphrase), to generate an 
	;             additional 8192 bytes of key material, which is then xor'd with the scrypt output.
	;      default: TLSv1.2 PRF(SHA256) is used, secret = passphase, label = 'key derivation', seed =
	;               SALT to generate an additional 8192 bytes of key material, which is then xor'd with
	;               the scrypt output.
	;
	;    Note that our use of scrypt, TLSv1.2 PRF, and HMAC_DRBG for key derivation are not NIST/FIPS
	;    approved methods of key derivation.
	;
	;    Once the above has derived 8192 bytes of key material, that is passed to the "htcrypt" set of
	;    functions, which is an encapsulation of 256 separate AES256 encryption and decryption contexts.
	;    As explained in the htcrypt.inc commentary, htcrypt's init then takes the first 64 bytes of
	;    the scrypt-generated key material, and uses it as its "main sequencer." It then initializes
	;    256 AES256 encryption contexts using 32 bytes each of the original 8192 bytes (32x256 == 8192).
	;    Then, using the last 64 bytes of the original 8192 bytes of key material as a "temporary
	;    sequencer", it encrypts the full 8192 bytes of key material 64 times, using the temporary
	;    sequencer bytes as indexes to the AES256 encryption contexts initialized before. It performs
	;    this "reencrypting the 8192 bytes of key material 64 times" a full 1024 times. This is
	;    effectively using AES256 as a CSPRNG to further arrive at a computationally difficult final
	;    set of 8192 bytes key material.
	;
	;    Once the final 8192 bytes of key material is arrived at, htcrypt then initializes all 256
	;    separate AES256 encryption and decryption contexts using 32 bytes each in succession. Unless
	;    the -1 option is specified, for later-done encrypt operations, each call to htcrypt$encrypt 
	;    actually results in 64 separate AES256 block encryptions, and the contexts used are determined 
	;    by the initial "main sequencer" noted earlier in forward order. For decrypt operations, the 
	;    "main sequencer" bytes are used in reverse for the underlying AES256 decrypt calls. If the -1
	;    option is set, only one AES256 context is used (at the end of the 8192 bytes of generated
	;    key material), and thus does not use cascaded AES256 like the default.
	;
	;    For the 128 bytes of HEADER_OR_IV described below, htcrypt encrypt/decrypt is then used in
	;    a CBC manner. The 16 byte IV is randomly generated, and then for each set of htcrypt
	;    contexts (one per passphrase set), the HEADER = HEADER xor IV, htcrypt$encrypt HEADER, 
	;    IV = IV xor HEADER, htcrypt$encrypt IV. (see below for more detail)
	;
	;    For the actual payload encryption, we make use of the "htxts" set of functions, which is
	;    identical to AES-XTS except for the use of htcrypt$encrypt and htcrypt$decrypt instead of
	;    a single AES256 encrypt/decrypt. The initial XTS 16 byte tweak value is the unencrypted
	;    first 16 byte IV (randomly generated). The first block of htxts plaintext is prepended with
	;    64 bytes of additional random IV.
	;
	;    For integrity verification, an HMAC-SHA512 is appended to the output, along with a partial
	;    randomly sized garbage block (to prevent all outputs from being 16-byte aligned).
	;
	; 2) Effective Security
	;    Reiterated:
	;    No "new" or "homebrew" crypto has been used here. AES256, HMAC-SHA512, scrypt (and thus
	;    PBKDF2), TLSv1.2 PRF(SHA256), HMAC-DRBG(SHA256), and XTS-AES (via htxts) have been put together
	;    in carefully considered ways to achieve the aforementioned design goals.
	;
	;    The point of cascading AES256 was not necessarily to increase the security of AES256 in and
	;    of itself, but to mandate the use and generation of a full 8192 bytes of key material. At best
	;    this dramatically increases its security, and at worst it falls back to a single-key AES256.
	;    If -1 is specified, thereby disabling cascaded AES256, then all of the encrypt/decrypt ops
	;    are "by the book" and the key material used for the single (and double for XTS) AES256 is
	;    taken from the end of the 8192 bytes of key material, still enforcing the use of 8192 bytes.
	;    If -1 is not specified (the default), then the effective security at the block level for the
	;    HEADER_OR_IV portion is somewhere above a single 32 byte AES256 key, and for the XTS portion
	;    somewhere above two 32 byte keys, and for our requirements this is more than sufficient.
	;    Noting here that there is ongoing debate about what the actual effective security gains are
	;    from performing cascaded AES256, but for the purposes herein, regardless of how that debate
	;    turns out, the design goals are satisfied.
	;
	;    At the time of this writing:
	;    Since related key attacks do not apply to this design, at the worst our HEADER_OR_IV (see below)
	;    security sits at 2**254, and if cascaded AES256 is enabled possibly much higher still. For the
	;    XTS payload encryption, since it uses two full sets of AES256 keys, and at worst we are at a
	;    "non-key-halved" full security of XTS-AES. If indeed cascaded AES256 lends to a security
	;    increase, it could further be argued that the use of the 64 bytes of sequencing material
	;    also contribute to the overall security. Either way, our baseline effective security is more
	;    than sufficient for the design goals herein.
	;
	;    The command line options for constructing key material complexity provide for a much higher than
	;    "typical" level of passphrase-based security, and at the end of the day, the effective security
	;    is most likely tied to the passphrase(s) as it should be. (Noting of course you could provide
	;    extremely high entropy passphrases and shift it the other way.)
	;
	; 3) Encryption output format
	;    Each output starts with a 32 byte SALT, followed by eight 16 byte blocks, each of which can be
	;    used as an IV or a HEADER block. These eight blocks are randomly ordered and selected at encrypt
	;    time, and a HEADER consists of the start and end offsets in the overall crypto stream. Which 2
	;    blocks get used by a given stream is chosen at random. If plausible deniability is enabled (and
	;    thus more than one encryption stream exists), each one chooses its own 2 random blocks. For
	;    unused blocks, they are simply PRNG initialized.
	;
	;    The order of input files is randomized before encryption begins (which may include "bogus"
	;    files, and/or alternates).
	;
	;    Following the aforementioned 32+128 bytes, up to four separate htxts encrypted payloads follow.
	;    Each plaintext payload is prepended with 64 bytes of PRNG, appended with a block sized
	;    padding, followed by an HMAC_SHA512 of the plaintext, followed by a random length (1..15) of
	;    garbage data.
	;
	;    Note that the 64 byte PRNG "preamble" does not increase security in any way, because we are not
	;    making use of block chaining (XTS-AES method is used). We do however include it in the HMAC
	;    calculation, as well as use the trailing 4 bits as our padding indicator.
	;
	;    Thus:
	;          [0..31] == SALT
	;          [32..47] == HEADER_OR_IV[0]
	;          [48..63] == HEADER_OR_IV[1]
	;          [64..79] == HEADER_OR_IV[2]
	;          [80..95] == HEADER_OR_IV[3]
	;          [96..111] == HEADER_OR_IV[4]
	;          [112..127] == HEADER_OR_IV[5]
	;          [128..143] == HEADER_OR_IV[6]
	;          [144..159] == HEADER_OR_IV[7]
	;          [160...] == crypted materials and PRNG mix (one or more)
	;          crypted material HTXTS(
	;            [0..63] == PRNG output
	;            [64..X] == plaintext
	;            [X..block-size-padded] == PRNG
	;            HMAC-SHA512(plaintext)
	;            garbage (random length 1..15)
	;
	;    HEADER and IV indexes are randomly selected (the list of 8 is scrambled initially)
	;
	;    All of the HEADER_OR_IV entries are initialized with PRNG output, and then for each input file
	;    specified (depending on -alt, -noalt, etc), an IV and HEADER block is selected.
	;
	;    If -alt is specified once or more (thus plausible deniability, aka multiple sets of valid keys/files),
	;    for each file specified an additional HEADER and IV is chosen. The list of input files is also 
	;    randomized. Four minus the number of input files "bogus" files are added and are PRNG-only output.
	;
	;    If -alt is not specified, and -noalt is also not specified (thus, one set of keys and one file),
	;    then three additional PRNG "bogus" files are added to the list and is PRNG-only output.
	;
	;    If -noalt is specified, then the a single header/IV is chosen, but the actual encrypted contents
	;    begin at offset 160 and no extra random data (other than the garbage/padding above) is added.
	;
	; 4) Decryption discovery/HEADER validity checking pseudocode
	;    For x in 0..7
	;      For y in 0..7
	;        if y <> x
	;          copy HEADER_OR_IV[x] to tempbuf[0]
	;          copy HEADER_OR_IV[y] to tempbuf[1]
	;          foreach key in reverse-order keys (keys == passphrase-derived htcrypt contexts)
	;            key.decrypt(tempbuf[0])
	;            xor tempbuf[0] with tempbuf[1]
	;            key.decrypt(tempbuf[1])
	;            xor tempbuf[1] with tempbuf[0]
	;          if (both qwords of tempbuf[1] are within bounds of filesize, and low qword < high qword)
	;            initial XTS tweak = tempbuf[0]
	;            start_ofs = low qword of tempbuf[1]
	;            end_ofs = high qword of tempbuf[1]
	;            goto success
	;          end if
	;        end if
	;    if we made it through the loop and arrived here, fail.
	;    success:
	;    previous_key = null
	;    foreach key in forward-order keys (keys == passphrase-derived htcrypt contexts)
	;      key.tweak = initial XTS tweak (from above discovery loop result)
	;      if previous_key <> null
	;        previous_key.encrypt(key.tweak)
	;      end if
	;      previous_key = key
	;
	; 5) Hacking and brute force recovery notes
	;   5.1) Password/passphrase based
	;     Key derivation is intentionally expensive, and with command line options to increase its
	;     complexity manifold. At a minimum, for each set of derived key material, the discovery process
	;     outlined in section #4 above would need to be completed in order to validate a given set
	;     of passphrase inputs. (Of course, you could skip the discovery process and attempt the
	;     XTS-AES sections instead, but then you would be forced to guess the location and extents of
	;     the actual payload, versus the HEADER/IV discovery process in section #4 which would yield
	;     those values anyway and is simpler compared to the XTS-AES process itself.)
	;
	;     The defaults contained herein, like many other key derivation settings, are a compromise
	;     between acceptable user-experience delays and the associated computational difficulty of
	;     brute forcing. At these levels on a local development machine, approximately 1.7 attempts per
	;     second per CPU core are possible.
	;
	;     For non-default settings, especially where multiple passphrases and high iteration counts
	;     are specified, things quickly become intractable (at least on consumer-grade hardware). By
	;     increasing the iteration count to 100,000 on the same local development machine the time
	;     per attempt goes up to 23 seconds per CPU core per passphrase.
	;
	;   5.2) Encryption and XTS description
	;     The SALT is only used for key material generation, and is not used at all for any subsequent
	;     encryption operations. Inside htcrypt.inc, if you enable htcrypt_debug_keymaterial, it will
	;     output the sequence and 256 AES256 keys that it uses to stderr.
	;
	;     Per the discovery method outlined in #4 above, the IV and HEADER are "CBC-style" encrypted,
	;     and the PRNG-generated plaintext IV is used as the initial XTS tweak block for actual payload
	;     recovery. Further to this, 64 bytes of random data is prepended to the first XTS block's
	;     plaintext (though as mentioned above, these 64 bytes do not affect security).
	;
	;     What this effectively means is that the XTS enc/decrypt operations are linked to the CBC-style
	;     IV and HEADER portion due to the use of the decrypted IV as the initial XTS tweak value.
	;
	;     At the time of encryption, the plaintext IV (which is then used as the initial XTS tweak) is
	;     PRNG output. The "CBC-style" means that the IV + HEADER are encrypted in the following way
	;     (per key in forward order):
	;         xor HEADER with IV (which is initial random plaintext IV, or last ciphertext IV)
	;         encrypt HEADER (set last ciphertext to result)
	;         xor IV with HEADER (which is last ciphertext)
	;         encrypt IV (set last ciphertext to result)
	;     then if there are more keys in use, the IV is still the "last ciphertext", per normal CBC-mode
	;     operation, despite reiterating over the same two blocks. (See section #4 for more details.)
	;
	;     For an attacker who has nothing but output from this code to work with, and is attempting to
	;     extract plaintext payload(s), there is no way to discern which of the 8 initial 16 byte blocks
	;     are IV or HEADER, so the same discovery process outlined in #4 would have to apply to any
	;     attempts on the HEADER_OR_IV blocks themselves.
	;
	;     In order to recover any plaintext payload(s), all sets of key material (and their respective
	;     AES256 contexts along with their sequencing), the decrypted IV, and the decrypted file offsets
	;     (start/end) are required.
	;
	;     If -1 was specified for a given inputfile, then the "htxts" operations here do not use
	;     cascaded AES256, and instead do "normal" single AES256 encryption. The tweak encryption key
	;     and the data encryption key in this mode are chosen from the end of the final 8192 bytes of
	;     key material. If -1 was not specified, thus cascaded AES256 is enabled, then the "htxts"
	;     methods used here are still done per the XTS-AES standard, but instead of using a single
	;     AES256, we use our cascaded AES256 htcrypt operations described above, and the tweak key
	;     is the first unused (in the main sequence) AES256 context, thus providing at most 65 full
	;     AES256 contexts for a normal htxts operation. "At most" being that the htcrypt sequencing
	;     may actually contain duplicate indexes.
	;
	;     Note that if multiple passphrases (and thus key material) were specified for a given inputfile,
	;     that even if -1 is specified, these do end up in a cascaded manner for both the HEADER_OR_IV
	;     and the XTS portion as outlined above.
	;
	;     Unlike traditional disk-based XTS-AES, we use the initial 16 byte plaintext (PRNG-generated)
	;     IV for the initial tweak value. This has the pleasant side effect that two plaintexts encrypted
	;     with the same set of key materials will not result in identical outputs.
	;
	;     htxts encrypt does (per block, which is 2048 bytes each):
	;       AES256 encrypt tweak with htcrypt.aeskeys[tweak key index] (not cascaded)
	;       for i in 0..127
	;         xor subblock[i] with tweak
	;         htcrypt.encrypt(subblock[i])
	;         xor subblock[i] with tweak
	;         LSFRshift(tweak)
	;     so to encrypt a block, the above is run in forward order for each set of keys, modifying the
	;     tweak (per key, each key has its own unique tweak) in-place through all blocks.
	;
	;   5.3) scrypt key derivation implementation and mixing strategies
	;     The HeavyThing scrypt implementation is a reference one, with N=1024, r=1, p=1 except for the
	;     fact that instead of using SHA256 as scrypt-proper does, we use SHA512 to initialize the state,
	;     and then for the final output stage, again we use SHA512. Note that the PBKDF2 iteration counts
	;     that scrypt uses for its init and final output stages we allow to override the default of 1.
	;
	;     The reason that mixing strategies of the final scrypt key material are employed is twofold:
	;     First, that there may be some issue with the scrypt output itself, and secondly that it forces
	;     any attacker to implement multiple key generation techniques as we have done here.
	;
	;   5.4) PRNG implementation
	;     The underlying HeavyThing library uses a modified version of Agner Fog's SFMT and Mother-of-all
	;     generators. He specifically states that they are safe to use _provided_ that only the combined
	;     output is accessible to an attacker, and that a complete subsequence of the output (in our case
	;     1408 bytes) is never revealed. Care is taken to satisfy these requirements.
	;
	;   5.5) HMAC-SHA512 integrity verification
	;     The primary purpose for appending HMAC-SHA512 is to verify the integrity of the encrypted
	;     payload to ensure that no tampering or other bit errors occur. Since the payload encryption is
	;     done with XTS-AES, single bit errors do not corrupt the entirety that follows, and as such may
	;     not necessarily be self-evident without employing integrity verification.
